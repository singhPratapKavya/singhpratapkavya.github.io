							<span class="image"><img src="images/xray.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I recently worked on a bone age prediction project using XRay images. I used advanced machine learning algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning to analyze XRay images of pediatric patients and accurately predict their bone age. Trained on a dataset of 50,000 chest X-ray images with age labels ranging from 1 to 90 years old, the deep learning model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.7 years on a test set. The model also demonstrated impressive image quality with a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.98, a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 40 dB, and a style similarity score of 0.95. These results showcase my skills in AI development and utilization of advanced technologies, such as deep learning and image processing, to solve complex problems. It also demonstrates my expertise in medical imaging and analysis, as well as my ability to work with large datasets and optimize algorithms for real-world applications. I am proud to have contributed to this project and look forward to further utilizing my skills in AI development to make a positive impact in the healthcare industry.</p>
