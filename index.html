					  <h2>Predicting Age from X Ray Images</h2>
					  <p>For the project "Predicting Age from X Ray Images," a deep learning model was trained using techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) to analyze features from X-ray images and predict the age of the patient based on the appearance of the bones. The model was trained on a large dataset of X-ray images from patients with known ages, and it learned to identify patterns and relationships between the visual characteristics of the bones and the patient's age. The project demonstrated the potential of deep learning techniques to analyze medical imaging data and make predictions about patient health and demographics. By accurately predicting patient age from X-ray images.</p>

					  <h2>Predicting Knee Osteoarthritis with Severity Grading</h2>
					  <p>In this project, I worked with a Knee Osteoarthritis Dataset that included information on patients with varying degrees of knee osteoarthritis. My task was to develop a model that could accurately predict the severity of knee osteoarthritis in new patients based on their X-ray images. To achieve this, I utilized computer vision techniques, specifically transfer learning with MobileNetV2, and implemented the model in TensorFlow using Python. By leveraging these tools and techniques, I was able to create a robust model that achieved an accuracy of 74% in predicting the severity of knee osteoarthritis across 5 different types of severity. This is a significant achievement that provides valuable insights into the progression of knee osteoarthritis and highlights the potential of computer vision and machine learning in the medical field.</p>

					  <h2>Semantic Segmentation for Remote Sensing</h2>
					  <p>The Semantic Segmentation for Remote Sensing project involves using deep learning techniques to classify and segment remote sensing images into different land cover classes. Remote sensing images are collected from satellites, aircraft, and other platforms, and they provide critical information about the Earth's surface, including vegetation cover, urban areas, water bodies, and more..The project involves developing a deep learning model using TensorFlow to perform semantic segmentation on remote sensing data. The model achieved a high mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) score of 0.85 on the test set, surpassing some state-of-the-art methods in the field. The model accurately classified various land cover types, including water bodies, forests, urban areas, and agricultural fields, with an average IoU score of 0.8 across all classes.

						<h2>Prediciting Flight Delays </h2>
						<p>As part of the study, I used machine learning and neural networks to predict flight delays. We analyzed historical flight data, including departure and arrival times, airline information, and weather conditions, to develop a model that could accurately predict the likelihood of a flight being delayed. To achieve this, I used Python programming language, along with machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras, to build and train the neural network model. The dataset used in the study consisted of hundreds of thousands of flights, and I used techniques like feature engineering and normalization to preprocess the data before feeding it into the model.</p>

						<h2>Bike Rental Analysis</h2>
						<p>This project involved analyzing bike rental behavior in Washington D.C. between 2012 and 2018 using over 1 million records of raw data. The data was cleaned and prepared for analysis, resulting in a dataset of over 250k records. Various regression models were built and tuned to predict the number of bike rentals on a given day, with an achieved accuracy of over 82% using XgBoost with hyperparameter optimization using GridSearch. The project used data such as weather, location, and time to enhance the model's performance. The analysis aims to understand the factors that influence individuals' decisions to cycle and overall trends in bike rental behavior in the city.</p>

						<h2>Housing Rent Predicter </h2>
						<p>
							Many students come from various locations and countries, making it challenging for them to budget and plan for housing expenses. Each student has unique needs and preferences, making it difficult to estimate the appropriate rent. Since housing is a fundamental requirement, I decided to conduct an analysis to help current and future students determine the most suitable rent prices for their needs. The dataset includes various characteristics such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, furnished options, laundry facilities, parking options, pet-friendliness, smoking policies, wheelchair accessibility, and even electric vehicle charging capabilities. Using various Machine Learning algorithms, I predicted the type of apartment based on these features and estimated the price of the apartment. This will aid students in making an informed decision on their housing choices and budgeting accordingly.
