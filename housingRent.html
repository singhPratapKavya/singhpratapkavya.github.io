                                Many students come from various locations and countries, making it challenging for them to budget and plan for housing expenses. Each student has unique needs and preferences, making it difficult to estimate the appropriate rent. Since housing is a fundamental requirement, I decided to conduct an analysis to help current and future students determine the most suitable rent prices for their needs. The dataset includes various characteristics such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, furnished options, laundry facilities, parking options, pet-friendliness, smoking policies, wheelchair accessibility, and even electric vehicle charging capabilities. Using various Machine Learning algorithms, I predicted the type of apartment based on these features and estimated the price of the apartment. This will aid students in making an informed decision on their housing choices and budgeting accordingly.
